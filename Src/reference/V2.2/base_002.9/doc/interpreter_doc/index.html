<H1><Center> uEACos Command Specification </center></H1>
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<blockquote> 
The uEAC hybrid computer is designed to explore novel paradims in the
area of analog computation. The analog backend of the machine is
augmented with a ucontroller interface. The ucontroller utilized is
the MSP430F169. The communication with the host is implented with an
FTDI2232C usb controller. The FTDI chip provides a virtual serial port
interface. 
<p>
To communicate with the uEAC, a serial console program such as hyperterminal
can be used to send command strings. These strings are used to
configure the analog circuitry of the system. The serial console
program should be configured as follows 19200 baud (8N1). 
<p> 
Each newline-terminated command is broken into fields that are delimited by a comma. When
a command is accepted, the uEAC will return "OK". If the command is
not accepted, the ueac will return "NOK". The commands are not case
sensitive and the fields can have embedded spaces. 
<p>
For commands that operate on a particular pin, the pins are numbered
by x,y pair. Where pin 1,1 is in the upper left corner of the
board. Pin 5,5 is in the lower right corner of the board.

<h2>Commands</h2>
<h3><i>Read All</i></h3>
Command returning reading from all 25 probe sites. If voltage mode is
sent, then a comma-delimited list of all of the pin voltages will be
returned. If current mode is sent, then only pins setup as current
output or LLA inputs will return numeric current values. Other pins
will return "*". 
<ul>
  <li><b>Format:</b> P,[V,I]\n
  <ul> 
    <li><b>P:</b> Read All Instruction Type
    <li><b>[V,I]:</b> V=voltage mode I=current mode
  </ul>
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Read the voltage present at each of the 25 grid nodes. 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "p,v\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i> "[voltage pin 1,1],[voltage pin 1,2],...[voltage
     pin 5,5],OK\n"
  </ul>   
</ul>  

<h3><i>Read Probe</i></h3>
Command allowing the voltage or current to be read from a particular
probe. The probe is specified by it's row,column grid
location. A numeric voltage will be returned from the specified grid
point. When in current mode, a numeric value will only be returned if
the pin is setup as a current output or LLA input/output. Voltage is returned
in volts and current is returned in uA.  
<ul>
  <li><b>Format:</b> R,[V,I],X_LOC,Y_LOC,[Value]\n
  <ul> 
    <li><b>R:</b> Read Probe Instruction Type
    <li><b>[V,I]:</b> V=voltage I=current
    <li><b>X_LOC</b> Position of the pin left to right. Ranges from
    1-5.
    <li><b>Y_LOC</b> Position of the pin top to bottom. Ranges from
    1-5.
    <li><b>[Value]</b> Dummy output current ranging from -200uA (sink) to
    200uA (source). Used to maintain parser commonality with the Write
    Probe commands. The value needs to be in the range
    -200<=value<=200.  
  </ul>
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Read the current flowing at pin 2,2. Assumes that pin 2,2 is setup
  as a current output or LLA input/output. 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "r,i,2,2,100\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i> "[current (uA) pin 2,2],OK\n"
  </ul>   
</ul>  

<h3><i>Write Probe</i></h3>
Command that allows a pin location to be written to a desired current
value. The current value can range from -200 to 200 uA. Negative
current values indicate a current sink. Positive values indicate a
current source. 
<ul>
  <li><b>Format:</b> W,I,X_LOC,Y_LOC,[Value]\n
  <ul> 
    <li><b>W:</b> Write Probe Instruction Type
    <li><b>I:</b> Current mode instruction
    <li><b>X_LOC</b> Position of the pin left to right. Ranges from
    1-5.
    <li><b>Y_LOC</b> Position of the pin top to bottom. Ranges from
    1-5.
    <li><b>[Value]</b> Output current ranging from -200uA (sink) to
    200uA (source). 
  </ul>
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Cause pin 1,1 to source 150uA. 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "w,i,1,1,150\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i> "OK\n"
  </ul>   
</ul>

<h3><i>LLA Instantiation</i></h3>
Command that allows LLA relationships to be added or removed. 
<ul> 
  <li><b>Format:</b>L,[A,D,E,R],XIN_LOC,YIN_LOC,XOUT_LOC,YOUT_LOC,NUM_DESCR,FUNC,PERIOD\n 
  <ul> 
     <li><b>L:</b> LLA Instantiation Instruction Type
     <li><b>[A,D,E,R]:</b> Add,Disable,Enable,Report
     <li><b>XIN_LOC:</b> LLA input Pin X location. Position of the pin left to right. Ranges from
    1-5. 
     <li><b>YIN_LOC:</b> LLA input Pin Y location. Position of the pin left to right. Ranges from
    1-5. 
     <li><b>XOUT_LOC:</b> LLA output Pin X location. Position of the
     pin left to right. Ranges from 0-5. 0 indicates that the output
     is virtual and is not physically connected to the sheet. Both the
     XOUT_LOC and YOUT_LOC need to be 0 to be accepted as a virtual
     output. 
     <li><b>YOUT_LOC:</b> LLA output Pin Y location. Position of the
     pin left to right. Ranges from 0-5. 0 indicates that the output
     is virtual and is not physically connected to the sheet. Both the
     XOUT_LOC and YOUT_LOC need to be 0 to be accepted as a virtual
     output. 
     <li><b>NUM_DESCR:</b> User defined numeric descriptor to use to refer
     to the specific lla. Ranges from 1-10.  
     <li><b>FUNC:</b> LLA Function number. This number can range from
     1-50. The functions are lookup tables that have an input range
     of 0-200uA and an output range of -200uA-200uA. The first 27
     functions are the 27 basic LLA functions described by Jonathan
     Mills. 
     <li><b>PERIOD:</b> Determines the rate at which the LLA should be
     evaluated. This number specifies the integer multiple of the base 10mS LLA
     evaluation interval. The period can range from 1-255. If the
     specified period is greater than 1, then the input pins is
     sampled at the base rate and averaged at the specified interval
     to use to look-up the output value. 
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3><i>Reset Board</i></h3>
Causes the MSP430 to go through a full system reset. This does not
effect the FTDI USB interface.
<ul> 
  <li><b>Format:</b> RST\n
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Resets the board causing all of the current sources to go back to a
  value of 0uA. 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "rst\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i> "OK\n" then goes through power-on-self-test to
     arrive back at the prompt. 
  </ul>   
</ul>  

<h3><i>LED Screen</i></h3>
These commands allow the LED screen to be enabled and disabled. The
LED screen is enabled by default. 
<ul> 
  <li><b>Enable Format:</b> LON\n
  <li><b>Disable Format:</b> LOF\n
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Turns off the LED screen. This might be important for noise
  reduction. 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "lof\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i> "OK\n" The screen is disabled immediately.
  </ul>   
</ul>  
<h3><i>Probe Calibration</i></h3>
Command that allows the probes on the board to be calibrated at
manufacturing test. This command requires the foam substrate to be
removed from the board to complete successfully. Do not run this
command unless you are certain that you know what you are doing. If
you run it by accident, just index through the tests using
enter. Indicate "n" when you are asked to commit the values to
external flash. 
<ul> 
  <li><b>Format:</b> CAL\n
  <li><b>example:</b>
  Calibrate the current supplies and measurement points. Each of the
  25 probes is calibrated at 200uA (output), 0uA (output), 200uA
  (input), 3.3V (input). 
  <ul>
     <li><i>host:</i> "cal\n" 
     <li><i>ueac:</i>
