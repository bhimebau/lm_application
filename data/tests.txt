063019 - performed using sensor 4 in the ISE fab lab widow sill. This
test was to make sure that data collection was working.

070119 - performed using sensor 4 and sensor 5. The sensors were
placed on the deck table of Bryce. This test was performed to get a
baseline for temperature of the board and battery.

070219 - repeated the test from 07-01-19. The afternoon high was 95
which should be a good indication of the max temp that the battery
will experience.
